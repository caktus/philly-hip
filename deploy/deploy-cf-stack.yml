          A changeset was created for the CloudFormation stack. You MUST login to the AWS console,
          inspect the changeset, and if everything looks good (i.e., it's not DELETING anything
          unexpectedly), execute the changeset. When complete, hit RETURN to continue or Control-C,
          then A to abort.
